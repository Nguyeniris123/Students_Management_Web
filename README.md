# ðŸŽ¯ Student Management System

## Description

The Student Management System is a web-based application designed to help schools manage student information, class lists, grades, and generate academic reports. The system is built with Flask (Python) for the backend and uses both REST APIs (called via JavaScript fetch) and server-side rendering with Flask templates (Jinja2) for the frontend.

## Key Features

- Students must be between 15 and 20 years old to enroll.

### 2. Class Management

- Support for 3 grade levels (10, 11, 12), minimum 1 class and maximum 40 students per class.

  - Minimum 1 and maximum 5 fifteen-minute tests.
  - Minimum 1 and maximum 3 one-period tests.
  - 1 final test per semester.
- Calculate average grades for each student and subject.
- Display subject grade sheets and class average grade tables.
